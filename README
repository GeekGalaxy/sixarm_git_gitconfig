Git configruation settings for our git users, command aliases, 
syntax coloring, branch management, and merge strategies.

!! Required

Customize the gitconfig file sections for user:

  [user]
    email = sixarm@sixarm.com
    name = SixArm

Customize the gitconfig file section for GitHub, if you use it:

  [github]
    user = sixarm
    token = sixarm-token


!! Recommended

Tell git-branch and git-checkout to setup new branches so that git-pull
will appropriately merge from that remote branch. Without this, you will 
have to add --track to your branch command or manually merge remote
tracking branches with "fetch" and then "merge".

  git config --global branch.autosetupmerge true
